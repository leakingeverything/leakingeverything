hi, we've been cracking and releasing software under various usernames since late 2009.
some software can and will flag your antivirus. this is because some software (mainly game cheats) inject into other games at a kernel level.

anything we release should be considered safe. we mean no harm to your computer, and we are funded by a private individual.
